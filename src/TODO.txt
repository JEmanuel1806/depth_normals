Problems:

only renders once for everything thats in view?
upper edge broken? (plane)
other models dont work correctly at all
do everything on gpu
performance (10 ms!)

Plan:

Double check the ID texture?
- add a debug shader
- render the normal texture to the screen in a separate pass

Doulbe check normal calculation.. obv
